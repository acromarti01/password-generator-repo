Password Generator Project

## Description

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation for tackling the project was to learn how to refactor code and make the website more accessiable.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built the project to further develop my skills with code refactoring and using Github to commit changes and push content to the githup repo. 

- What problem does it solve?

    Code refactoring helps with solving conflicts users with disabilties face when looking at a website. The users could be blind or deaf and code refactoring helps overcome those problems.

- What did you learn?

    I learned different ways to refactor code such as how to use semantic structure to organize my CSS selectors and provide CSS comments to increase readability.

<!-- Moving to the repo, fantastic work giving it a unique name, committing multiple times, and creating a README with all the requirements. I suggest displaying the screenshot instead of providing it as a link. To do so, add a "!" before the alt text and remove "Screenshot" within the parentheses. It should look like this, Screenshot. Here is a link on markdown that may help, https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/mastering-markdown-32d4cb2c4091.  -->
